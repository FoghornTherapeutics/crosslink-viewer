The code uses a postgress database but it should be easily changed to another db.

You will need to create a database table called 'upload'.

The table requires following columns:
	'rand', a random key used for URL
	'links', csv data file as a string
	'fileName', shown inpage title
	'layout', used for saved layout
	'fasta', protein sequence data as fasta file format string
    'annot', stores uploaded custom annotation info

You will need to add the connection string for your database into these files: 
	fup.php, handles file upload then redirects to unique URL
	uploaded.php, displays data, needs random key as http get parameter
	saveLayout.php, writes saved layouts into db	

You can do this by either: 
- editing php/uploadsConnnectionString.php to conntain the connection string
	and changing uploaded.php, line 10; fup.php, line 5; and saveLayout.ph, line 4 
	to read include('./uploadsConnectionString.php');
	[i.e. replace "../../" with "./" so that it uses the file in the 'php' folder, 
	rather than two directories up, outside the git repository]
	
- OR just adding the connection string to uploaded.php, line 9; fup.php, line 4; and saveLayout.ph, line 3.
	[remove the "//" from the start of those lines so they are not commented out and add connection information]
	

The connection string looks like:
$connectionString = "host=yourhost dbname=yourdbname user=yourusername password='yourpassword'"; 
 	

careful not to check your db password into github :) 

example.html contains an example html form for file upload.
