================

A web based visualisation of cross-link / mass spectrometry data developed by the Rappsilber Laboratory.

The uniprot DAS service is no longer used for looking up sequences and uniprot annoataions. The text based web service at http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/ is used instead.
As a consequence, it can now retreive sequences for isoforms (which were missing from the DAS service).

Rappsilber Laboratory is funded by the Wellcome Trust.
